# seir-model
The aim of this bachelor thesis is to create a mathematical compartment model with the
compartments susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered / dead (SEIR) in discrete-time
form and then to simulate and predict the
epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 including interventions.
The data provided by the Robert Koch Institute should be read in efficient
modified and approximated to the SEIR model in order to 
find estimators for the past couple of months and use these to
simulate scenarios.
